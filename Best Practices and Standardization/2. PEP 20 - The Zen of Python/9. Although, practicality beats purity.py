'''
We must remember that the ultimate goal is to solve real problems and write code that performs some particular (expected) task. 
If your code is elegant, readable, and complies with all the important styling conventions, but does not function the way it should, 
then it doesn't make much sense, does it?

If the possible benefits (e.g., better performance) are larger than the possible negative effects (e.g., affected maintainability), 
the real-world coding problems may find an excuse for making an exception to the rules. Practicality then becomes more important than purity.

If you need to write an 85-character long line of code because splitting it into two separate lines affects readability, do it. 
If you need to keep compatibility with previously written code and use CamelCase instead of snake_case, do it. 
Rules sometimes have to be broken, exceptions have to be made.
